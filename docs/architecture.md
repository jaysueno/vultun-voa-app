## Business Logic Implementation

### 1. Booking Management
```typescript
interface BookingLogic {
  checkAvailability(serviceId: string, date: Date): Promise<boolean>;
  assignStaff(booking: Booking): Promise<Staff>;
  allocateRoom(booking: Booking): Promise<Room>;
  processPayment(booking: Booking): Promise<Payment>;
}
```

### 2. Payment Processing
```typescript
interface PaymentLogic {
  calculateCommission(booking: Booking): number;
  processPayment(payment: Payment): Promise<PaymentStatus>;
  generateReceipt(payment: Payment): Promise<Receipt>;
}
```

### 3. Staff Management
```typescript
interface StaffLogic {
  createSchedule(staff: Staff, period: DateRange): Promise<Schedule>;
  calculateCommission(staff: Staff, period: DateRange): Promise<number>;
  trackPerformance(staff: Staff): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>;
}
```
