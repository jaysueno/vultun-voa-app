Now that we have the basic structure set up, let me explain how to use Cursor effectively for your project:
Cursor Features and Best Practices:
Context Window:
Cursor maintains context of your open files
Keep related files open in tabs to help me understand your codebase better
Use the file explorer to navigate between files
Agent Mode (Current Mode):
I can help you write, debug, and explain code
Ask me specific questions about your code
Request help with implementing features
Ask for explanations of code concepts
Ask Mode:
For quick questions about your code
Use when you don't need full context
Good for syntax questions or quick fixes
Code Navigation:
Use Cmd/Ctrl + P to quickly find files
Use Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P for commands
Use the file explorer to navigate your project structure
Development Workflow:
Version Control:
Use the Git panel for commits
Write descriptive commit messages
Create feature branches for new features
Use pull requests for code review
Testing:
Write unit tests for critical functionality
Test components in isolation
Use the terminal to run tests
Debug using console.log or browser dev tools
Debugging:
Use console.log for quick debugging
Use browser dev tools for frontend issues
Use the terminal for backend issues
Ask me for help with specific errors
Next Steps for Your Project:
Set up the authentication pages (login/signup)
Create the services listing page
Implement the booking system
Create the admin dashboard
Add payment integration
Implement the calendar feature
Would you like me to help you implement any of these next steps? Or do you have any questions about using Cursor or the code we've written so far?
